            advanced: { reps: 120, points: 90 } // 2 minutes
        }
    }
}
```

### Exercise Detection Algorithms

**MediaPipe Configuration**:
```javascript
pose.setOptions({
    modelComplexity: 1,
    smoothLandmarks: true,
    minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,
    minTrackingConfidence: 0.5
});
```

**Push-up Detection**:
- Use nose (landmark 0) and shoulders (landmarks 11, 12)
- Calculate relative nose-to-shoulder Y position
- Threshold: 0.3 for down position detection
- Complete rep: down → up transition

**Squat Detection**:
- Use hips (landmarks 23, 24) and knees (landmarks 25, 26)
- Calculate hip-to-knee Y difference
- Threshold: 0.1 for down position
- Complete rep: standing → squatting → standing

**Jumping Jack Detection**:
- Use wrists (landmarks 15, 16) and ankles (landmarks 27, 28)
- Measure arm spread (wrist distance) and leg spread (ankle distance)
- Arm threshold: 0.4, leg threshold: 0.3
- Complete rep: closed → open → closed

**Lunge Detection**:
- Use knees (landmarks 25, 26) and ankles (landmarks 27, 28)
- Calculate knee-ankle difference between left and right sides
- Threshold: 0.15 for lunge position
- Complete rep: standing → lunging → standing

**Plank Detection**:
- Use nose (0), shoulders (11, 12), and hips (23, 24)
- Calculate body alignment (shoulder-hip Y difference)
- Good plank: alignment < 0.1
- Count time in seconds instead of reps

## Game Mechanics

### Bird Behavior
- **Face Following**: Bird Y position directly follows detected face Y coordinate
- **No Gravity**: Physics only apply after face detection
- **Smooth Movement**: Interpolated positioning with 0.1 smoothing factor
- **Visual**: Radial gradient (green center → cyan → blue edge) with glow effect

### Exercise-Specific Obstacle System
Each exercise type has unique obstacle patterns optimized for that movement:

**Push-ups**:
- Gap position: 65% from top (encourages going down)
- Gap size: 150px
- Obstacle speed: 2.5 units
- Spacing: 280px (3-4 second rhythm)
- Description: "Navigate by doing push-ups - lower body to go through gaps!"

**Squats**:
- Gap position: 75% from top (encourages squatting low)
- Gap size: 140px
- Obstacle speed: 2.0 units
- Spacing: 320px (4-5 second rhythm)
- Description: "Squat down to fly through the lower gaps!"

**Jumping Jacks**:
- Gap position: Random (30-70% to encourage varied movement)
- Gap size: 160px
- Obstacle speed: 3.0 units
- Spacing: 220px (2-3 second rhythm)
- Description: "Jump and spread to control your flight!"

**Lunges**:
- Gap position: Alternating between 40% and 75% from top
- Gap size: 145px
- Obstacle speed: 2.2 units
- Spacing: 300px (4-5 second rhythm)
- Description: "Lunge to navigate through alternating obstacles!"

**Plank**:
- Gap position: 50% from top (straight body position)
- Gap size: 180px (largest for holding)
- Obstacle speed: 1.0 units (slowest for static hold)
- Spacing: 400px (wide spacing for hold exercise)
- Description: "Hold plank position to fly straight through!"

**Dynamic Features**:
- Speed increases slightly every 5 successful obstacle passes
- Gap positioning adapts to exercise movement patterns
- Obstacle spacing matches natural exercise rhythm

## Critical Implementation Updates (Based on Development Experience)

### 1. Camera Access Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Camera will NOT work with file:// URLs. Must serve via local server:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js  
npx http-server -p 8000
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000

### 2. CRITICAL: Obstacle Overlap Prevention
**PRODUCTION BLOCKER FIX**: The most critical issue was obstacles overlapping and making the game unplayable.

#### Root Cause
- **Dual Creation Systems**: Both legacy `createPipe()` and new `createNextExerciseObstacle()` running simultaneously
- **Race Conditions**: `lastObstacleCreated` initialized to 0 causing immediate obstacle creation
- **Timing Conflicts**: Complex phase management logic creating multiple obstacles

#### Required Implementation
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Single obstacle creation system only
function shouldCreateNextObstacle() {
    const currentTime = Date.now();
    const difficultyMult = difficultyMultipliers[difficultyLevel];
    
    // MANDATORY: Minimum spacing to prevent overlaps
    const minimumInterval = 4000; // Absolute minimum 4 seconds between obstacles
    const baseInterval = 5000; // Base 5 second interval for safety
    const adjustedInterval = Math.max(minimumInterval, baseInterval * difficultyMult.spacingMultiplier);
    
    // STRICT timing check - must wait full interval
    const timeSinceLastObstacle = currentTime - exerciseState.lastObstacleCreated;
    if (timeSinceLastObstacle < adjustedInterval) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Only create if not waiting for phase completion
    if (exerciseState.waitingForPhaseCompletion) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return true;
}

// CRITICAL: Proper initialization
const startTime = Date.now();
exerciseState = {
    currentPhase: 'up',
    phaseStartTime: startTime,
    phaseCompletedCount: 0,
    nextObstacleType: 'down',
    waitingForPhaseCompletion: false,
    lastObstacleCreated: startTime, // MUST initialize to current time, NOT 0
    exerciseMode: 'guided'
};

// CRITICAL: Remove legacy pipe creation
// DO NOT call createPipe() in startGame() - causes overlaps
// Use ONLY the exercise-driven system
```

#### Key Rules for Obstacle Generation
1. **Single Creation Path**: Only use `createNextExerciseObstacle()` system
2. **Strict Timing**: Minimum 4-5 seconds between obstacles
3. **Proper Initialization**: Set `lastObstacleCreated` to `Date.now()` at start
4. **No Dual Systems**: Remove any legacy `createPipe()` calls
5. **Debug Logging**: Add console.log to track obstacle creation timing

### 3. Stage Progression System
**NEW FEATURE**: Dynamic stage progression that evolves with player performance.

#### Stage Definitions
```javascript
const gameStages = {
    stage1: { minScore: 0, name: "Warm-up", modifier: 1.0, description: "Getting started" },
    stage2: { minScore: 5, name: "Building momentum", modifier: 1.1, description: "Slightly faster pace" },
    stage3: { minScore: 10, name: "Finding rhythm", modifier: 1.2, description: "Steady challenge" },
    stage4: { minScore: 20, name: "Flow state", modifier: 1.3, description: "In the zone" },
    stage5: { minScore: 30, name: "Elite performance", modifier: 1.4, description: "Master level" }
};

function getCurrentStage() {
    for (let i = 5; i >= 1; i--) {
        const stage = gameStages[`stage${i}`];
        if (score >= stage.minScore) {
            return stage;
        }
    }
    return gameStages.stage1;
}
```

#### Stage-Based Modifications
- **Obstacle Speed**: Base speed × difficulty multiplier × stage modifier
- **Gap Size**: Slightly reduced as stages advance (difficulty is primary factor)
- **Visual Feedback**: Stage name and motivational message displayed on game canvas
- **Progressive Challenge**: Smooth difficulty increase based on player progress

#### Implementation in Obstacle Creation
```javascript
const currentStage = getCurrentStage();
const finalSpeed = baseSpeed * difficultyMult.speedMultiplier * currentStage.modifier;
const finalGapSize = Math.max(120, stageAdjustedGapSize * (1 - (currentStage.modifier - 1) * 0.1));
```

### 4. Improved Difficulty Balance System

#### Difficulty Multipliers (Updated)
```javascript
const difficultyMultipliers = {
    beginner: {
        speedMultiplier: 0.6,  // Slightly slower for beginners
        gapSizeMultiplier: 1.8,  // Larger gaps (80% increase - more reasonable)
        spacingMultiplier: 1.8,  // 80% more time between obstacles
        holdTimeMultiplier: 1.5  // 50% longer hold times for learning
    },
    intermediate: {
        speedMultiplier: 1.0,
        gapSizeMultiplier: 1.0,
        spacingMultiplier: 1.0,  // Normal spacing
        holdTimeMultiplier: 1.0  // Normal hold times
    },
    advanced: {
        speedMultiplier: 1.4,  // Faster for challenge
        gapSizeMultiplier: 0.75,  // Smaller gaps (25% reduction)
        spacingMultiplier: 0.6,  // 40% less time between obstacles
        holdTimeMultiplier: 0.7  // 30% shorter hold times for speed
    }
};
```

### 5. Progress Percentage Fix
**CRITICAL**: The progress percentage was not updating due to exercise detection sensitivity.

#### Exercise Detection Improvements
```javascript
// Improved push-up detection with better sensitivity
let pushupThreshold = 0.08; // Reduced from 0.15 for easier detection

function pushupDetection(landmarks) {
    const nose = landmarks[0];
    const leftShoulder = landmarks[11];
    const rightShoulder = landmarks[12];
    
    if (!nose || !leftShoulder || !rightShoulder) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const shoulderY = (leftShoulder.y + rightShoulder.y) / 2;
    const relativeNoseY = nose.y - shoulderY;
    
    // More sensitive detection with smaller buffers
    const isCurrentlyDown = relativeNoseY > (pushupThreshold + 0.02);
    const isCurrentlyUp = relativeNoseY < (pushupThreshold - 0.02);
    
    if (isCurrentlyDown && lastPosition === 'up') {
        lastPosition = 'down';
        return false;
    } else if (isCurrentlyUp && lastPosition === 'down') {
        lastPosition = 'up';
        return true; // Complete rep
    }
    return false;
}
```

#### Progress Display System
```javascript
function updateStats() {
    // Enhanced error checking and debug logging
    const currentRepsEl = document.getElementById('currentRepsDisplay');
    const targetRepsEl = document.getElementById('targetRepsDisplay');
    
    if (currentRepsEl) currentRepsEl.textContent = currentReps;
    if (targetRepsEl) targetRepsEl.textContent = targetReps;
    
    // Force update progress percentage in instructions
    const progress = Math.floor((currentReps / targetReps) * 100);
    const instructionText = document.getElementById('instructionText');
    if (instructionText && repCompleted) {
        instructionText.textContent = `💪 Great rep! (${currentReps}/${targetReps}) - ${progress}%`;
    }
}
```

### 6. Updated Game Mechanics

#### Bird Control System
- **Direct Face Tracking**: Bird Y position follows face position directly (no gravity)
- **Movement Speed**: 35% interpolation factor for responsive but smooth control
- **Velocity Cap**: Maximum velocity of 8 to prevent erratic movement
- **Starting Position**: 30% from top of canvas for safety

#### Obstacle Speed Settings (Updated)
```javascript
const exerciseGameSettings = {
    pushups: {
        obstacleSpeed: 4.5,  // Increased from 2.5
        obstacleSpacing: 280,
        gapSize: 150
    },
    squats: {
        obstacleSpeed: 3.5,  // Increased from 2.0
        obstacleSpacing: 320,
        gapSize: 140
    },
    jumpingjacks: {
        obstacleSpeed: 5.0,  // Increased from 3.0
        obstacleSpacing: 220,
        gapSize: 160
    },
    lunges: {
        obstacleSpeed: 4.0,  // Increased from 2.2
        obstacleSpacing: 300,
        gapSize: 145
    },
    plank: {
        obstacleSpeed: 2.0,  // Increased from 1.0
        obstacleSpacing: 400,
        gapSize: 180
    }
};
```

#### Difficulty Multipliers
```javascript
const difficultyMultipliers = {
    beginner: {
        speedMultiplier: 0.7,
        spacingMultiplier: 1.3,
        gapSizeMultiplier: 1.2
    },
    intermediate: {
        speedMultiplier: 1.0,
        spacingMultiplier: 1.0,
        gapSizeMultiplier: 1.0
    },
    advanced: {
        speedMultiplier: 1.3,
        spacingMultiplier: 0.8,
        gapSizeMultiplier: 0.85
    }
};
```

### 3. Color-Coded Obstacle System

#### Push-ups Pattern (3-cycle):
1. **High Gap (25% from top)** - Green pipes - Stay in up position
2. **Low Gap (75% from top)** - Red pipes - Go down into push-up
3. **Middle Gap (50% from top)** - Blue pipes - Transition zone

#### Squats Pattern (alternating):
- **Low Gap (80% from top)** - Red pipes - Squat down
- **High Gap (30% from top)** - Green pipes - Stand up

#### Color Gradients for Pipes:
```javascript
// Green (high gaps - stay up)
gradient: '#10b981' → '#059669' → '#047857'

// Red (low gaps - go down)  
gradient: '#f59e0b' → '#dc2626' → '#b91c1c'

// Blue (middle gaps - transition)
gradient: '#8b5cf6' → '#6366f1' → '#3b82f6'
```

### 4. Dynamic Instructions System

Instructions must preview upcoming obstacles and handle consecutive same-type gaps:

**Push-ups Examples**:
- Single red gap: "⬇️ Go DOWN for red gap! (0/20) - 0%"
- Multiple red gaps: "⬇️ STAY DOWN for multiple red gaps! (0/20) - 0%"
- Red then green: "⬇️ Go DOWN then prepare to PUSH UP! (0/20) - 0%"

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Check next two pipes for better instructions
let nextPipe = pipes.find(p => !p.passed && p.x > bird.x - 100);
let secondPipe = pipes[pipes.indexOf(nextPipe) + 1];

// Provide contextual instructions based on pattern
```

### 5. Exercise Detection Fixes

#### Push-up Detection:
- **Threshold**: 0.15 (reduced from 0.3 for better sensitivity)
- **Debug logging**: Add console.log for detection troubleshooting
- **Rep counting**: Update both currentReps and pushupCount

#### Workout Completion:
- Calculate points based on completion percentage
- Show actual reps completed (not 0)
- Only increment streak if target reps achieved
- Call completeWorkout() even on early game over

### 6. MediaPipe Initialization

```javascript
// Wait for libraries to load
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        // Check if libraries loaded
        if (typeof Pose === 'undefined') {
            alert('MediaPipe not loaded. Check internet connection.');
            return;
        }
        
        // Initialize with error handling
        const camera = new Camera(webcamElement, config);
        camera.start().catch(error => {
            alert('Camera access denied. Please grant permissions.');
        });
    }, 1000);
});
```

### 7. Timer Implementation Details
- Initialize timer with `gameStartTime = Date.now()` in startWorkout()
- Update every 100ms for smooth display
- Show motivational messages on canvas overlay
- Color transitions: Green (0-30s) → Cyan (30-60s) → Blue (60-120s) → Purple (120s+)

## Final Implementation Requirements

### Deployment Checklist
1. **File Structure**: Create `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `game.js`
2. **CDN Dependencies**: Include MediaPipe Pose and Camera Utils
3. **Local Server**: Set up Python/Node.js server for camera access
4. **Error Handling**: Implement all camera permission and MediaPipe checks
5. **Debug Features**: Include debug button for testing progress system

### Testing Protocol
1. **Start Server**: `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx http-server`
2. **Navigate**: Go to `http://localhost:8000`
3. **Grant Permissions**: Allow camera access when prompted
4. **Test All Exercises**: Verify each exercise type works
5. **Test All Difficulties**: Ensure proper scaling for beginner/intermediate/advanced
6. **Verify Obstacles**: Confirm single obstacles with proper spacing
7. **Check Progress**: Verify percentage updates during exercise detection

### Success Criteria
- ✅ No overlapping obstacles (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Progress percentage updates correctly
- ✅ All exercise types functional
- ✅ Camera integration working
- ✅ Stage progression visible
- ✅ Responsive design on all screen sizes

Create this application with all the fixes and improvements listed above. The game should be responsive, accurately track exercises, and provide clear visual feedback through color-coded obstacles and dynamic instructions.
