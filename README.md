## <ï¿½ Tips for Success

### Camera & Setup
-  **Use good lighting** - avoid backlighting
-  **Clear background** works best for pose detection
-  **Stable camera position** - don't move your device
-  **Wear contrasting clothes** to your background

### Exercise Form
-  **Go slow and controlled** - better detection than fast movements
-  **Hold positions briefly** - gives the system time to register
-  **Full range of motion** - complete the entire movement
-  **Face the camera** - side views don't work as well

### Gameplay Strategy
-  **Watch upcoming obstacles** - plan your movement ahead
-  **Follow the color system** - green = up, red = down
-  **Use the rest time** between obstacles to recover
-  **Start with beginner** if you're new to the game

### Troubleshooting
- L **Bird not moving?** Check that your face is detected (green box)
- L **Reps not counting?** Ensure full range of motion and proper form
- L **Camera not working?** Make sure you're using localhost, not file://
- L **Game too fast/slow?** Adjust difficulty level to match your fitness
